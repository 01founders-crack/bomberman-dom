Collecting workspace informationYour project structure and code organization are well-aligned with the requirements described in README_info.md. Hereâ€™s a summary of your setup:

**Folders and Files:**
- index.html and styles.css: For your static HTML and CSS.
- server.js: WebSocket server for multiplayer and chat.
- main.js: Entry point for your frontend app.
- index.js: Your custom mini-framework.
- game: Contains all core game logic (`game.js`, `map.js`, `player.js`, `bomb.js`, `powerup.js`, `utils.js`).
- chat.js: Handles chat via WebSocket.
- ui: UI components (`lobby.js`, `hud.js`).
- images: Placeholder for images.
- README.md and README_info.md: Project documentation.

**Observations:**
- You are using your own mini-framework (`render`, `createElement`), as required.
- Game logic is modularized (players, bombs, map, powerups, etc.).
- The chat system is implemented using WebSockets.
- The UI is separated into components (lobby, HUD).
- The server broadcasts messages to all clients, suitable for multiplayer and chat.
- You are not using canvas or external frameworks, which matches the project constraints.

**Suggestions:**
- Consider adding a `tests/` folder for unit tests if you want to ensure code quality.
- Expand your framework utilities in index.js as your UI grows.
- Make sure to handle edge cases in multiplayer synchronization and game state updates.

Your project is well-structured and ready for further development!
