Your project structure and base code are solid! Here’s some advice for your next steps:

### 1. **Connect the Pieces**
- Use your mini-framework (`render`, `createElement`) to build and display the lobby, HUD, and game board in `main.js`.
- Set up navigation between lobby, game, and results screens.

### 2. **Implement Game Logic**
- Integrate player movement and bomb placement (listen for keyboard events, update state, and re-render).
- Handle bomb explosions, map updates, and player deaths.
- Add power-up spawning and collection logic.

### 3. **Multiplayer Synchronization**
- Use WebSocket messages to sync player actions and game state between clients.
- Decide on a simple protocol for game events (move, bomb, powerup, etc.).

### 4. **UI/UX Improvements**
- Style your components for clarity and fun.
- Add feedback for actions (animations, sounds, etc.).

### 5. **Testing and Debugging**
- Add unit tests for your utility and game logic functions.
- Test multiplayer with multiple browser tabs.

### 6. **Polish and Expand**
- Add more power-ups, maps, or game modes.
- Improve error handling and edge case management.

**Tip:**  
Work incrementally—get a simple version working, then add features step by step.  
If you want a specific feature or code example, just ask!
