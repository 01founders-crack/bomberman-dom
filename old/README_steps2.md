Collecting workspace informationYour project structure and base screens are set up. Hereâ€™s what you should do next, step by step:

1. **Remove duplicate DOMContentLoaded logic**  
   Your main.js currently has two `DOMContentLoaded` listeners and two different rendering approaches. Keep only the one using your mini-framework (`render`, `createElement`) and remove the manual DOM manipulation at the bottom.

2. **Connect Lobby to WebSocket**  
   Update the lobby to show all connected players using `connectChat` and WebSocket messages. When a player joins, broadcast their nickname and update the player list for everyone.

3. **Implement Game Start Logic**  
   Add logic to start the game when enough players have joined or the timer expires, as described in README_info.md.

4. **Render Players and Bombs**  
   In your game screen, use `renderPlayer` and `renderBomb` to display players and bombs on the board.

5. **Handle Player Input**  
   Listen for keyboard events to move the player and place bombs. Update the game state and re-render as needed.

6. **Sync Game State**  
   Use WebSocket messages to synchronize player actions (move, bomb, etc.) and game state between clients.

7. **Add Chat UI**  
   Create a simple chat box in the lobby and game screens, using your chat module.

8. **Polish and Test**  
   Test with multiple browser tabs. Add styles, animations, and handle edge cases.
